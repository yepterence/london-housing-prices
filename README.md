Project Overview Here   is   the   question   you   are   trying   to   solve   while   working   on   this   case   study: Which   borough   of   London   has   seen   the   greatest   average   increase   in   housing   prices   over the   (approximately)   two   decades   covered   by   the   dataset? Context: A   borough   is   just   a   fancy   word   for   district.   There   are   32   London   boroughs   within   Greater London,   and   each   borough   has   its   own   governing   council.   As   you   can   guess,   some   of them   are   more   desirable   to   live   in   and   will   reflect   that   desirability   in   a   greater   rise   in housing   prices
